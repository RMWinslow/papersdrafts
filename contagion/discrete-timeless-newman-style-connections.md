# Newman-style disease network, discrete choice over number of neighbors.






    





# TODO Tomorrow
- [] Finish copying over discrete version (streamlined without fluff)
- [] Combine Poisson and Discrete nieghbors:
    - Start with discrete results
    - Set that number of neighbors as the mean in a poisson distribution
    - Integrate the discrete results over that poisson distribution.
    - Will it collapse to be the same as poisson or will it turn into something more interesting?
