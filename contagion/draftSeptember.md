I construct a simple model to endogenize social connections, in which these connections have associated benefits and costs. The expected benefit or harm from a contagion is a function of the number of connections an individual has, and is so in a non-linear way. And so if the population of agents is initially heterogenous in the number of such connections, the introduction of a new contagion will increase  the heterogeneity of the population in this way. (Not snappy enough. TODO: rewrite later.)

Flip a bag of coins. If any of them land on tails, then you die. Would you rather flip a bag filled with one hundred tiny coins, or a big with just one really big coin the size of a pancake?
