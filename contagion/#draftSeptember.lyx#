\begin_layout Title
Social Polarization in Response to Contagions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
I construct a very simple utility-based model of social connections which
 leads to variation in the number of social connections each person has.
 When the threat of a contagion is introduced, highly connected individuals
 have less incentive to break off marginal social connections than do less
 connected individuals.
 This increases the variance of the distribution of connections, which has
 important implications in understanding the spread of contagions such as
 disease.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why does it seem that some highly secluded people with very low exposure
 risk are highly concerned about social distancing, while other more gregarious
 individuals at very high risk of exposure don't seem to care at all?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the personal risk from a contagion is the same for two individuals, then
 an individual with a very high number of social connections expects to
 almost certainly be exposed to the contagion regardless of any marginal
 changes they make to their behavior.
 But for an individual with very few connections, slight changes in their
 behavior can drastically reduce their disease risk.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I construct the simplest model which I can think of that results in individuals
 choosing to have different numbers of social connections.
 Then when the threat of of contagion is introduced, the risk to an individual
 comes from their neighbors, but this risk is spread out in a non-linear
 way.
 The very first neighbor provides the highest expected risk of contagion,
 and subsequent neighbors provide exponentially decreasing expected disease
 exposure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because of this, the variation and spread of a disease 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
A simple model of endogenous social connections
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I make assumptions about the utility of maintaining social connections,
 and about the disutility of being exposed to contagion, such that individuals
 with lots of neighbors are precisely those who won't decide to socially
 distance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Social Connections
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a unit mass of individuals, indexed by 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 from 0 to 1.
 Each individual person can be thought of as one of the vertices in a social
 graph, where the edges of the graph represent person-to-person connections
 along which contagions, such as disease or information, can potentially
 spread.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each person 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in(0,1)$
\end_inset

 has some randomly determined exogenous level of social skill or social
 capital 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa_{x}$
\end_inset

.
 If the process for generating 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa$
\end_inset

 has distribution function 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{\kappa}$
\end_inset

, then without loss of generality, we can order the indices so that 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{\kappa}(\kappa_{x})=Pr(\kappa\leq\kappa_{x})=x$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each person chooses how many 
\begin_inset Formula $n\geq0$
\end_inset

 social connections (edges in the social graph) they wish to maintain, and
 uses these connections to improve their own welfare.
 These connections could be thought of employment which allows the person
 to buy sandwiches, agreements with neighbors to cooperate on household-producti
on, or intrinsically rewarding social interactions like friendships and
 dance partners.
 Higher levels of social capital enable a person to get more utility out
 of each connection, but there are diminishing returns to seeking out new
 connections.
 The utility that person 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 with social capital 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa_{x}$
\end_inset

 gains from maintaining 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 connections is 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{1-\alpha}\kappa_{x}n^{1-\alpha}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha\in(0,1)$
\end_inset

 is a parameter common across people.
 Here, the connections are formed randomly, with each person not knowing
 the index or social capital of their neighbors.
 And non-integer numbers of connections are allowed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the maintenance of each social connection requires effort which incurs
 exogenous disutility 
\begin_inset Formula $\varpi$
\end_inset

, then person 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

's utility as a function of their choice of social connections is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
U_{x}(n)=\frac{1}{1-\alpha}\kappa_{x}n^{1-\alpha}-\varpi n
\]

\end_inset

 If 
\begin_inset Formula $n(x)$
\end_inset

 denotes person 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

's optimal number of social connections, then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
n(x)=\left(\frac{\kappa_{x}}{\varpi}\right)^{1/\alpha}
\]

\end_inset

The above equation on also gives us the distribution over degrees in the
 social graph.
 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{N}\left(n(x)\right)=Pr\left(n(x)\leq\kappa_{x}\right)=x$
\end_inset

Transmission of the contagion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is some contagion which spreads through the network in an SIR manner.
 Like in (Newman 2002)

\end_inset

, which provides a general description of evaluating the spread of disease
 through a network, I'm considering the spread of the epidemic by looking
 at it's final outcomes rather than by looking at the time-path of infectious
 frequency among the population.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If a person is infected with the contagion, then they experience additional
 disutility 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

.
 Multiple infectious exposures don't incur any additional disutility.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{\delta x}=1$
\end_inset

 iff person 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is exposed to the contagion at some point during the epidemic, and 0 otherwise.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When a person first hears about the epidemic, they choose how many social
 connections to maintain for it's duration.
 Their expected utility is 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}\left[U_{x}(n,\delta)\right] & =\mathbb{E}\left[\frac{1}{1-\alpha}\kappa_{x}n^{1-\alpha}-\varpi n-I_{\delta x}\delta\right]\\
 & =\frac{1}{1-\alpha}\kappa_{x}n^{1-\alpha}-\varpi n-Pr(I_{\delta x}=1)\cdot\delta
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is the transmissibility of the contagion.
 It is the chance that an infected person will transmit the disease to an
 uninfected person given that they share a social connection.

Contrast 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{0}$
\end_inset

, the basic reproduction number, which is the average number of new infections
 generated by each infection when the entire population is initial susceptible.
 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{0}$
\end_inset

 is determined by a combination of the transmission rate and structure of
 social interactions.

\end_layout

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 here is the same for all connections.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{\infty}$
\end_inset

 denote the portion of the population that is exposed to the disease throughout
 the entire course of the epidemic.
 Because people are assumed to not know the connectivity of their neighbors,
 each person expects that each of their neighbors will become infected with
 probability 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{\infty}$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{\infty}$
\end_inset

 is determined in equilibrium through the choices of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 by the individuals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The chance that the contagion is transmitted along any particular social
 connection is 
\begin_inset Formula $TR_{\infty}$
\end_inset

.
 This is the probability that that neighbor gets sick times the probability
 that they transmit along that particular social connection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But infection occurs in person 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 iff 
\emph on
at least
\emph default
 one of their neighbors transmits the infection to them.
 If you are a person in this social network with 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 neighbors, then the chance that none of your neighbors transmits to you
 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[1-TR_{\infty}\right]^{n}$
\end_inset

.
 And the the chance that at least one of your neighbors transmits to you
 is 
\begin_inset Formula $1-\left[1-TR_{\infty}\right]^{n}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathbb{E}\left[U_{x}(n,\delta)\right]=\frac{1}{1-\alpha}\kappa_{x}n^{1-\alpha}-\varpi n-\delta+\delta\left[1-TR_{\infty}\right]^{n}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta=0$
\end_inset

, then this is the same as the baseline model without contagion.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta>0$
\end_inset

, then the contagion is something bad like a disease.
 And if 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta<0$
\end_inset

, then the contagion is something beneficial like technological diffusion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If people choose their social connections for the duration of the epidemic
 in an expected utility maximizing way, then the optimal number of connections
 for person 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $n(x,\delta)$
\end_inset

 satisfies
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
0=\kappa_{x}n(x,\delta)^{-\alpha}-\varpi+\delta n(x,\delta)\left[1-TR_{\infty}\right]^{n(x,\delta)-1}
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left\{ ...\right\}

If a person cuts off a social connection, then the increase in expected
 utility from decreased infection risk is 
\begin_inset Formula

This function exhibits exponential decay.

\begin_layout Subsection
Main Consequence
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because any individual can only become infected with a contagion once, and
 because the chances of avoiding infection exponentially decay with number
 of connections, highly connected individuals will change their behavior
 less in response to the threat of contagion.
 An introvert with very low social capital and hence very few connections
 can drastically increase their safety by cutting off a marginal social
 connection.
 But an extrovert with a very large number of connections would experience
 almost no benefit from doing so.
 The same highly connected individuals who drive the spread of contagion,
 are also the individuals least likely to self-interestedly take steps to
 mitigate the spread.
