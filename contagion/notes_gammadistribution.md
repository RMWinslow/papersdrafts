## Goal
- Want to find a utility function such that the optimal response to contagion risk in the Newman+Poisson case has a nice analytical solution
- Use this to force the distribution of connections to be distributed according to a gamma distribution so that the offspring distribution becomes Negative Binomial.
- Connect to the Schreiber Paper


## Gamma distribution facts








## Potential Utility function

Simplifying a bit,
(utility and disutility left unspecified)
 the individual's problem becomes 

> Taking $$\Psi$$ as given, choose $$N$$ to solve $$N=\argmax_N [u(N) - p(N)]$$

Now make the following assumptions about the disutility incurred by disease risk $$p(N)$$:
- Diseasee risk disutility $$p(N)$$ is a strictly increasing function of $$N$$
- Marginal disutility from disease risk $$p'(N)$$ is a strictly decreasing function of $$N$$ (concave down) ($$p'' < 0$$ 

And the following assumptions on regular utility from connections $$u(N)$$:
- Marginal connection utility is diminishing in number of connections. $$u'' < 0$$

Potential optimums occur where $$u' = p'$$










# TODO for this page:
- [ ] Copy over the properties of gamma distribution
- [ ] Find individual $$R_0$$ of a given type. (Mean number of spreads? Just NT, right?)
- [ ] Find utility function that makes this take on a nice form.
    - [ ] I think I have a text file somewhere with a note about the typical distribution of actual social connections. Find that and compare to the social connections induced in my model?
- [ ] Connect Schreiber model of Gamma Poisson spread to an indidivual's problem.
