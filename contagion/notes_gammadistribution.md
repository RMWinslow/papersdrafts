## Goal
- Want to find a utility function such that the optimal response to contagion risk in the Newman+Poisson case has a nice analytical solution
- Use this to force the distribution of connections to be distributed according to a gamma distribution so that the offspring distribution becomes Negative Binomial.
- Connect to the Schreiber Paper
