# Trying to find a convinient form for the utility function.

In the Newman+Poisson case, each individual takes $$\Psi\in[0,1]$$ for granted and chooses $$N\in\R_+$$ as their connection rate to maximize $$U(N;\Psi)=u(N)-p(N;\Psi)$$ where $$p(N;\Psi)=1-e^{-\Psi N}$$.

I would like to choose a utility function such that the following properties hold:
- **Nice form:** The best response $$N^*(\Psi)$$ takes a nice analytic form and can be easily adjusted based on some parameter.
- **FOC works:** U is concave down, so that I can use FOCs to find this best response.
    - This means that not only do we need diminishing marginal utility of connection, but it must be extreme enough to counterbalance the diminishing marginal cost of connection.
- **Bounded connections:** Even in the absence of a contagion, the best response is finite.
- **Gumption:** If $$\Psi=1$$ then the best response is nonetheless *not* $$N=0$$. Even at the most extreme, the agents (or at least some of them) don't want to just cut off all contact completely.
    - Ideally, they return right back to the same level of social connection as at $$\Psi=0$$
- **Elasticity:** I wan the response to increasing contact risk to be big enough to easiy see on a graph.




## Let utility be negative exponential

$$u(N) = -\frac{\theta}{\rho} e^{-\rho N}$$

$$U(N;\Psi,\delta) = -\frac{\theta}{\rho} e^{-\rho N} - \delta[1- e^{-\Psi N}]$$

- Paramater domains: $$\rho,\delta,\theta\in(0,\infty)$$, $$\Psi\in[0,1]$$, $$N_{BR} \in [0,\infty)$$
- Marginal utility: $$\frac{d}{dN}U = \theta e^{-\rho N} - \delta \Psi e^{-\Psi N}$$
    - Where FOC  is appropriate, it resolves to the single critical point $$N^* = \frac{\ln(\delta\Psi/\theta)}{\Psi-\rho}$$
        - At this point, probability of infection is $$1-e^{-\psi N^*} = 1-\left[{\delta\Psi\over\theta}\right]^{-\Psi/(\Psi-\rho)}$$
    - Because $$U'$$ is continuous, this point exists iff both $$\Psi\neq 0$$ and $$\Psi\neq\rho$$
    - Whenever it exists, it is the only critical point, and thus at least one of $$N^*,\infty,0$$ are the best response.
        - If it's a local maximixa, then $$N_{BR}=N^*$$
    - When it doesn't exist, or when its a local minima, the function is monotonic or constant and thus at least one of $$0,\infty$$ maximizes utility.
- Second derivative: $$\frac{d}{dN}\frac{d}{dN}U =  - \theta\rho e^{-\rho N} + \delta \Psi^2 e^{-\Psi N}$$
    - If the critical point $$N^*$$ exists, then $$U''(N^*) = [\Psi-\rho] \cdot (\delta\Psi)^{\frac{-\rho}{\Phi-\rho}}\theta^{\frac{\Psi}{\Phi-\rho}}$$.
    - Thus if $$\Psi > \rho$$, $$N^*$$ is a local minima, and the optimum is at the boundaries.
    - If $$\rho < \Psi$$, then the $$N^*$$ is a local maxima and thus the optimum.
- Cross derivative: $$\frac{d}{d\Psi}\frac{d}{dN}U = \delta e^{-\Psi N}[\Psi N -1]$$, 
    - giving us the standard $$N=\frac{1}{\Psi}$$, $$p(N;\Psi)=1-\frac{1}{e}$$ fatalism threshold when the FOC is valid.
    - For the critical point to be at this threshold, it must be that $$1-\frac{\rho}{\Psi}=\ln(\frac{d\Psi}{\rho})$$.

To reiterate conditions for optimum (See paper notes [6-30 D+] for flowchart):
- If $$\Psi = 0$$: then $$N_{BR}=+\infty$$
- If $$\Psi\in(0,\rho)$$: 
    - If $$\delta\Psi \geq \theta$$: then  $$N_{BR}=0$$
    - If $$\delta\Psi \leq \theta$$: then  $$N_{BR}=N^*=N^* = \frac{\ln(\delta\Psi/\theta)}{\Psi-\rho}$$
- If $$\Psi\geq\rho$$: 
    - If $$\delta < {\theta\over\rho}$$: then  $$N_{BR}=+\infty$$
    - If $$\delta = {\theta\over\rho}$$: then  there are multiple optima, includeing $$N=0$$ and $$N=+\infty$$.
    - If $$\delta > {\theta\over\rho}$$: then  $$N_{BR}=0$$

Sufficient conditions for $$N_{BR}=N^*$$: $$\Psi\neq0$$ and $$\delta < \theta$$.
- If $$\delta > \theta$$ and $$\rho < \frac{\theta}{\delta}$$,then the optimum will initially shrink and then pop back up to infinity asymptotically at $$\Psi\geq\rho$$
- If $$\delta > \theta$$ and $$\rho > \frac{\theta}{\delta}$$, then the optimum will initially shrink, but then get 'stuck' at $$N=0$$ when $$\Psi$$ goes to $$\theta\over\delta$$ 
- If $$\delta = \theta$$ and $$\rho < 1$$,then the optimum will initially shrink and then pop back up to infinity asymptotically at $$\Psi\geq\rho$$
- If $$\delta = \theta$$ and $$\rho \geq 1$$,then the optimum will initially shrink and then get stuck at $$N=0$$ as $$\Psi\to1$$.
- If $$\delta < \theta$$ and $$\rho \leq 1$$,then the optimum will initially shrink and then pop back up to infinity asymptotically at $$\Psi\geq\rho$$
- If $$\delta < \theta$$ and $$\rho > 1$$,then the optimum will be positive for all $$\Psi\in(0,1]$$, 
    - but will the person ever hit the fatalism threshold and start ramping up their connections? We can check by evaluating $$\frac{d}{d\Psi} N^* = \frac{1-\frac{\rho}{\Psi}-\ln(\frac{\delta\Psi}{\theta})}{(\Psi-\rho)^2}$$ at $$\Psi=1$$
    - The denom is always positive and the numer evaluates to $$1-p-\ln(\delta/\theta)$$, so 
    - If  $$\delta < \theta$$, $$\rho > 1$$, and $$(\rho-1) < \ln(\theta/\delta)$$, then the optimum dips down and then rises back up.
    - If  $$\delta < \theta$$, $$\rho > 1$$, and $$(\rho-1) > \ln(\theta/\delta)$$, then the optimum continually falls as $$\Psi$$ increases to 1.

Now which of my desired properties does this utility have?
- [x] Nice Form
- [x] FOC Works
    - Kinda. The function isn't convex or concave, but it does have at most one critical point, which is all I actually need I think. As long as $$\Psi\in(0,\rho)$$ and $$\delta\Psi < \theta$$, the optimum is at that critical point.
- [ ] Bounded Connections
    - Alas, no. Especially not at 0.
- [x] Gumption
    - Depends on parameters. But as long as $$\delta < \frac{\theta}{\rho}$$, the best response goes to infinity as $$\Psi\to1$$.
- [x] Elasticity

### Inducing specific values.

Sadly, $$N_{BR}=\infty$$ in the absence of a contagion.
But good news, I can easily choose parameters to make it such that the person choose a specific number of connections in the extreme case where $$\Psi=1$$:
- When $$\Psi=1$$, if $$\rho > 1$$, $$N_{BR}=N^*=\frac{\ln(\delta/\theta)}{1-p} = \frac{\ln(\theta/\delta)}{p-1}$$. 
- Solve for $$\theta/\delta$$ to get $$\frac{\theta}{\delta}=e^{(\rho-1)N^*}$$
- So to get parameters such that $$N^*(\Psi=1)=N_i$$:
    - pick any $$üçå > 1$$, 
    - set $$\rho=\ln(üçå)+1$$ (Or choose $$üçå=e^{\rho-1}$$)
    - set $$\theta = \delta üçå^{N_i}$$
        - For simplicity, you can normalize $$\delta=1$$. This degree of freedom was changing the utility but not the best response function.
- Then with these paramaters, the level of $$\Psi$$ point at which the person starts to become fatalistic is found by solving $$1-\frac{\rho}{\Psi}=\ln(\delta\Psi/\theta)$$ which becomes $$1-\frac{\ln(üçå)+1}{\Psi}=ln(\Psi/üçå^{N_i})$$
    - This becomes $$e^{1+\rho N - N} = \Psi e^{\rho/\Psi}$$
    - PLugging this into wolfram, with $$0 < \Psi < 1$$ and $$LHS > e^\rho$$ gets me the solution $$\Psi = \frac{-\rho}{W_{-1}(\frac{-\rho}{ee^{\rho N-N}})}$$, where $$W^{-1}$$ is a branch of the Lambert product log doohicky.
    - Sadly, I can't solve better than that. But I can say that as $$N_i$$ increases, the threshold $$\Psi$$  starts at 0, decays quickly, then continues to decay but more slowly.
- The condition for rising but finite optimum as $$\Psi\to1$$ becomes $$üçå>1$$ and $$\ln(üçå) > \ln (üçå^{N_i})$$, which implies $$N_i > 1$$. 
- With $$\delta=1,\theta_i=e^{(\rho-1)\bar N_i}$$, the optimum turns into a nice linear equation of $$N_i$$: $$N^*_i = \frac{\ln\Psi}{\Psi-\rho} - \frac{\rho-1}{\Psi-\rho} \bar N_i$$
    - Slope isn't an issue because gamma distribution has nice scaling factor 
    - But interecept changes, which is a problem because the support of a gamma distribution is $$(0,\infty)$$

Here's an alternate way to induce specific values (see [7-01 D]):
- When $$\Psi=1$$, $$N^*=\frac{\ln(\theta/\delta)}{\rho-1}$$
- Set $$\delta=1$$, and solve for $$\rho$$ to get $$\rho_i = \frac{\ln\theta}{N_i} + 1$$
    - Note that now evaluating $$\frac{d}{d\Psi}N_i^*$$ at $$\Psi=1$$ yields $$\frac{1-\rho_i-\ln(\frac{\delta}{\theta})}{(1-\rho_i)^2} = \frac{-\frac{\ln\theta}{N_i}+\ln\theta}{(-\frac{\ln\theta}{N_i})^2}= \frac{[1-{1\over N}]\ln\theta}{(\frac{\ln\theta}{N_i})^2} = \frac{[N_i-1]N_i}{\ln\theta}$$
    - Given that $$\theta > 1$$, the numerator there is positive as long as $$N_i > 1$$.
- Then in general, $$N_i^* = \frac{\ln(\Psi/\theta)}{\Psi-\rho} = \frac{\ln(\Psi/\theta)}{\Psi-\frac{\ln\theta}{N_i}-1} $$
    - Doesn't directly evaluate at $$N_i=0$$, but the limit $$N_i\to 0$$ is zero, and the support of a gamma distribution is just $$(0,\infty)$$ anyways.
    - Bad news, $$N_i^*\to\infty$$ as $$\Psi\to 0$$ for any value of $$N_i > 0$$.
        - Doesn't mess with my existence proofs, but does mean that $$\psi\neq 0$$ in equilibrium. An epidemic doesn't necessarily occur, but there is always the chance one **might**. This maybe seems like a unrealistic assumption to go along with the notion that people want infinite connection in the absence of a contagion, but my attempts to deal with it haven't born fruit.

## Neggexp utility with a baseline 'background contagion'


$$u(N) = -\frac{\theta}{\rho} e^{-\rho N} + \Delta e^{-\phi N}$$

$$U(N;\Psi,\delta) = -\frac{\theta}{\rho} e^{-\rho N} + \Delta e^{-\phi N} - \delta[1- e^{-\Psi N}]$$

- Marginal utility: $$\frac{d}{dN}U = \theta e^{-\rho N} -\phi \Delta e^{-\phi N} - \delta \Psi e^{-\Psi N}$$

This way is not analytically solvable, I don't think.

### Take 2: What if the two contagions are mutually exclusive and have the same cost.

So basically, we're just hardcoding a minimum risk level.

Then (and see [7-01 C] for more details):

$$u(N) = -\frac{\theta}{\rho} e^{-\rho N} $$

$$U(N) = -\frac{\theta}{\rho} e^{-\rho N} - \delta[1- e^{-(\Psi+\phi-\Psi\phi) N}]$$

- Marg utility:
- Critical Point: $$N^* = \frac{\ln ((\Psi+\phi-\Psi\phi)/\theta)}{\Psi+\phi-\Psi\phi-\rho}$$
- Inducing a distribution at $$\Psi=0$$:
    - At $$\Psi=0$$, $$N^*=\frac{\ln(\phi\delta/\theta}{\phi-\rho}$$
    - Fix $$\rho,\phi$$, set $$\delta=1$$, and solve for $$\theta$$ to get $$\theta_i = \phi e^{[\phi-\rho]N_i}$$
    - Plug this back into $$N^*$$ to get $$N^*_i = \frac{\ln(1+\Psi(\frac{1}{\phi}-1))}{\phi+\Psi-\Psi\phi-\rho} + \frac{\phi-\rho}{\phi+\Psi-\Psi\phi-\rho}N_i$$
        - Slope is constant and increases as $$\Phi\to1$$
        - Intercept drops into the negatives, but that's fine I suppose. That's just some mass of people that stop connecting. The distribution of connections can then be imputed from the rest of the people.
        - The main problem is that $$\phi$$ is necessarily very small and less than $$\rho$$, so $$\theta < \delta$$, and as per notes above, we won't see any fatalism for $$\rho > 1$$
    - Alternatively set $$\delta=1$$ and solve for $$\rho$$ at $$\Psi=0$$ to get $$\rho_i = \phi - \frac{\ln(\phi/\theta)}{N_i} = \phi + \frac{\ln\theta-\ln\phi}{N_i}$$
    - Plug *this* one back in to get $$N^* = \frac{\ln ((\Psi+\phi-\Psi\phi)/\theta)}{\Psi-\Psi\phi - \frac{\ln\theta-\ln\phi}{N_i} }$$
        - Mostly has nice properties in terms of intercept and monotonicity, but:
        - Kind of a mess to look at.
        - For any $$\Psi > \phi$$, there is some $$N$$ such that every $$N_i > N$$ yields a $$\rho_i < \Phi$$, which leads to an asymptotic BR. 
        - This is a really weird implication. For example, let $$\theta=e, \psi=e^{-9}$$ Then anyone who desires more than $$\approx$$ 10 connections when there isn't a contagion desires an infinite number of connections when there *is* a contagion that is guaranteed to transmit?! It's an understandable implication of the way I set things up but it's not at all what I wanted.



# A quick notes for tomorrow:


I tried to find a cost function that doesn't lead to an infinite critical point $$\Psi=0$$.

I'm really tire so I don't know if this makes any sense.
But if cost is $$\Psi^{1-\Psi}\cdot[1-e^{-\Psi N}]$$,
Then the marginal utility becomes $$U' = \theta e^{-\rho N} - \Psi^\Psi e^{-\Psi N}$$,
which makes the critical point $$N^* = \frac{\Psi\ln\Psi-\ln\theta}{\Psi-\rho}$$.
And the limit of this as $$\Psi\to0$$ is $$\ln\theta\over\rho$$.

That's.. I don't know if that's useful. 
Does this cost function even have a reasonable interpretation?
At least on [0,1], $$\Psi^\Psi$$ is strictly increasing, so it's not like (Wait not is it? It's not right?)

Actually I think this implies that a more transmissive contagion reduces the cost of connections. THat's not what I want at all.

## TODO with this:
- [ ] What if I just multiply by $$\Psi$$ instead of $$\Psi^\Psi/\Psi$$
- [ ] What if I divide the benefit by $$\Psi$$? Like risk of contagion decreases the joy of communing with others? Will that have a similar effect? (Wait no, I don't think that will work. It's the **zero** contagion case that's causing me problems.
- [ ] Some other stuff to try to make the optimum noninfinite at 0. Subtract AN? constant cost of connections?

Or if that doesn't work, just give up, make the graphs, assume we aren't in a disease free equilibrium, and start writing stuff up.
