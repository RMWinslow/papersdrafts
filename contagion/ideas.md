# Ideas for where to go next:

> Every time I turn on NPR, I hear about some acute loss

- What's missing from these models?
- Stochastic Markov process (Ben Mol)?
- Incorporate infection rate
- Take that little example of the incentives involved in cutting off a social connection, 
  - determine equilibrium invariant distribution
  - or imposed fixed cost/benefit of gaining or losing connections and fixed cost of infection risk
    - Use solutions from Phelan's stuff to find out what kinds of connections are in equilibrium?






# Running out of time. Where do I take the quick paper.

Think. It's due at 4pm. So allocate an hour to reformatting text, and give it an hour per page of writing. and an hour for lining up the sources, then I need started writing hardcore by 4 in the morning. 

## option 1: expand on that example of nonlinear expected disutility

- type it up 
- add in explicit model of forming connections
- claim that adding a disease exposure risk makes distribution of connections more heterogenous.
- include examples about basketball
- link to paper about how this could be bad (aids)
- link to paper about how this could be good for lowering disease threshold.
- link to paper about differences implied by a network structure and the importance of R_0 vs r. tranmission vs *other term I can't remember*
- Other stuff to potentially include:
  - Cost of forming connections
  - cost of cutting connections?
  - convexity of prefences over people?
  - difference between several independent draws or one dependent draw
    - (spending all your time with one person vs spending all your time with multiple people)
  - disease risk proportional to number of neighbors
    - don't know the type of neighbor? so can't selectively cut them
    - should neighbors have variable value to the person
    - altruism (of one person(grandma) or of everyone)
    - static perspective per period.
      - but this will just be equivalent to saying that people who like to have conncetions will have more connections. Not super interesting. 
      - Unless focus on the increase in variance
- mention future plans about explicitly modelling a time path.


## option 2: Focus on the distributionary effects themselves. 
 
- link to paper about how this could be bad (aids)
- link to paper about how this could be good for lowering disease threshold.
- This being credible depends on the paper about how heterogeneity is the cause of outbreaks and herd immunity. If the distribution there fits with teh invariant blagblah, then maybe this approach works.
- But my best guess is that leaning towards option 1 will have the more fruitful result
