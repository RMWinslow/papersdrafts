# Ideas for where to go next:

> Every time I turn on NPR, I hear about some acute loss

- What's missing from these models?
- Stochastic Markov process (Ben Mol)?
- Incorporate infection rate
- Eigengen vectors and eigenvalues
  - fixed points in distribution are eigenvectors
- "What number do you want to reduce?"
- Take that little example of the incentives involved in cutting off a social connection, 
  - determine equilibrium invariant distribution
  - or imposed fixed cost/benefit of gaining or losing connections and fixed cost of infection risk
    - Use solutions from Phelan's stuff to find out what kinds of connections are in equilibrium?

- Jorge asks why he cares less and less as time goes by. 
  - "Why is it that as time goes by I stop caring?
  - "Learning I won't get it." 
  - Disease exposure is highly correlted geographically/socially. A priori it is difficult to tell whether you will have high disease exposure, but as the pandemic goes on you gain more info about the fact that you dont 
  - Home production decaying?
  - "Odds of getting sick with a fixed cost?" What did I mean here?
  
- notes from bad talk I gave
  - "icing model" on symettric tree? typo?
  - ideal branching problem
  - Tom Holmes on Walmart
    - How do you build a new walmart
  - continuous time markov process, exponentially meeting with different types, keeping track of meeting people who are sick and healthy
  - what set of parameters are stable in equilibrium where people are trying to decide to cut off a marginal connection?






# Running out of time. Where do I take the quick paper.

Think. It's due at 4pm. So allocate an hour to reformatting text, and give it an hour per page of writing. and an hour for lining up the sources, then I need started writing hardcore by 4 in the morning. 

## option 1: expand on that example of nonlinear expected disutility

- type it up 
- add in explicit model of forming connections
- claim that adding a disease exposure risk makes distribution of connections more heterogenous.
- include examples about basketball
- link to paper about how this could be bad (aids)
- link to paper about how this could be good for lowering disease threshold.
- link to paper about differences implied by a network structure and the importance of R_0 vs r. tranmission vs *other term I can't remember*
- Other stuff to potentially include:
  - Cost of forming connections
  - cost of cutting connections?
  - convexity of prefences over people?
  - difference between several independent draws or one dependent draw
    - (spending all your time with one person vs spending all your time with multiple people)
  - disease risk proportional to number of neighbors
    - don't know the type of neighbor? so can't selectively cut them
    - should neighbors have variable value to the person
    - altruism (of one person(grandma) or of everyone)
    - static perspective per period.
      - but this will just be equivalent to saying that people who like to have conncetions will have more connections. Not super interesting. 
      - Unless focus on the increase in variance
  - Look at various forms of social distancing schemes
  - maybe the hit will be a fraction of existing utility?
- mention future plans about explicitly modelling a time path.
- integrate over distribution to get expected externaility from some particular individual getting sick
- shutting down $c$ portion of individuals or shutting down $c$ portion of all conncections - analogue in terms of incentives is place huge disincentive on one person or small disincentives on everyone. But disincentives on activity don't have same coorespondence to lockdown. Lump sum tax on every activity, Or huge tax on randomly chosen activities. Compare to that simple model used in class.
- Options
  - Shut down all connections for subsection
  - shut down some fraction of connections for everybody
  - impose fixed cost on each connection
  - 


## option 2: Focus on the distributionary effects themselves. 
 
- link to paper about how this could be bad (aids)
- link to paper about how this could be good for lowering disease threshold.
- This being credible depends on the paper about how heterogeneity is the cause of outbreaks and herd immunity. If the distribution there fits with teh invariant blagblah, then maybe this approach works.
- But my best guess is that leaning towards option 1 will have the more fruitful result
