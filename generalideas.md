- HO with overlapping generations  
  - Read [Tim's paper](https://users.econ.umn.edu/~tkehoe/papers/DemographicsHO.pdf) and 
  - see if it fits that vague idea I had about the tradeoff between utility and growth
  - the main argument for growth is that it improves the lives of people who are not yet born and thus don't have a say in the decision making
    -In that Ho example from Tim, trade reduces growth rates
- HO or just general trade models recontextualized as partially segregated sets of workers with the same country (race caste etc.) What happens when the inability for labor to move relaxs. In trade literature those two places become the same country.
- In the prelim paper from doireann, home production allows for gains from uncertainty by providing an outside option
  - What if that is removed
  - in particular, consider cities. Living in a city increses the expected value of having a job but also reduces the capacity for home production (or does it?)
    - No land for growing food
    - dependent on utilities
    - limited space
    - permits
    - but more social connections, yeh?

- Write a response to that mental illness guy with the gtth test. 
  - Point out empirical results about adhd in particular
  - point out that utility theory doesn't work that way
    - example 1: different preferences for leisure vs thinkery
    - example 2: different costs for thinkery
    - impose gtth: strong disutility if thinkery below threshold. In either example, behavior will change.
  - trembling hand etc. as alternate forms of representation of mental illness

- social shaming + externalities
- Global timing game
- American Pie parody but lyrics are about forcibly collectivizing aggriculture
